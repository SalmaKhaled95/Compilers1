ebnf: contains ebnf
working parser: contains a parser that reads from a file and outputs to file
tree and things: contains implementation of tree class in c++ and the parser code after converting  to python with tree that didn't work well but i wasted a lot of time trying to make it in QT and transferring code to python, also it contains a project that i didn't complete that joins scanner and parser because dr said it's ok not to join them
old scanner after little modification: contains old scanner with modification to output
**************
it's better to start by running the working parser project by giving it scanner output files that are:
word space colon space word optional word
check scanner output file that is in this folder
